# Dropout Rate Calculation Formula

## Formula

```
dropout = clamp(0.25 + 1 / (complexity + 2), 0.1, 0.6)
```

- `complexity`: A number reflecting your model’s complexity (e.g., number of layers, or a custom “complexity” score).
- `clamp(min, max)`: Ensures the final dropout rate stays within `[0.1, 0.6]`.

## Explanation

This formula helps you set a **good default dropout rate** based on model complexity:

- For **simple models** (low `complexity`), dropout is higher to prevent overfitting.
- For **complex models** (high `complexity`), dropout is lower to avoid underfitting.
- The `clamp` keeps the result in a reasonable range, since dropout above 0.6 and below 0.1 is rarely effective.

> **Example:**
> - For a model with `complexity = 2`:
>   `dropout = clamp(0.25 + 1/(2+2), 0.1, 0.6) = clamp(0.25 + 0.25, 0.1, 0.6) = 0.5`
> - For a deeper model with `complexity = 8`:
>   `dropout = clamp(0.25 + 1/(8+2), 0.1, 0.6) = clamp(0.25 + 0.1, 0.1, 0.6) = 0.35`

## Python Code Example

```python
def clamp(value, min_value, max_value):
    return max(min_value, min(value, max_value))

def compute_dropout(complexity):
    # Recommended dropout formula based on model complexity
    return clamp(0.25 + 1 / (complexity + 2), 0.1, 0.6)

# Example usage:
print(compute_dropout(2))  # Output: 0.5
print(compute_dropout(8))  # Output: 0.35
```

## Notes
- For `complexity`, use the number of layers or blocks, or estimate based on model size.
- Typical dropout values in practice are 0.2–0.5 for most models.
- This formula provides a safe, research backed starting point.
